							<h1>What are the backrooms?</h1>
							<p>The backrooms are a sort of "glitch" in the matrix we call the real world. The backrooms are places that should not exist, they are outside that natural law of everything: physics, order, human nature. The backrooms are laid out in levels, they are numbered level 1, 2, 3... etc they can also go negative (-1, -2... etc). each level has unique properties that affect their layout, appearance, physics and gimmicks (For lack of a better word). The way you enter the backrooms is if you no-clip and fall into them, you fall into level 0 and have to learn how to no-clip to escape. 
                            <p>Food and water depend on the kind of level you are in but most lack food or water heavily. This unfortunately leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths stretching across decades that were previously unresolved missing persons cases. The backrooms are also home to special creatures called "Entities" Since they exist in the backrooms Their Biology, Physiology and Physics all can be vastly different from the Frontrooms. Hope this helped explain the backrooms. :)</p>
                            <h2>About the backrooms</h2>        
                            <p>The backrooms are originally a concept made by Kane Pixels, a Director and VFX artist for short films one of which is called "Backrooms (Found Footage)" in which a teenager is recording a video for his friends and accidently no-clips into the backrooms, while in there he records his surroundings of level 0, about an hour after he starts walking around an enitity made of black bacteria chases him and he falls through the floor and back into the Frontrooms 10km in the sky and falls to his death. The found footage was heavily corrupted and only ~10 minutes was saved on a recording. After this video was published it grew a massive fanbase who wanted to know more and many different internet groups made their own stories and canons for the idea of the backrooms.</p>
							<p>I am one of the people that loves the idea of the backrooms, specifically the altered physics and natural order which is super interesting.</p>
