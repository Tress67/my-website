							<h1>Level 0</h1>
							
							<p>Level 0 is the first level of the backrooms and serves as a "tutorial level" for those who fall into the backrooms for the first time.</p>
							<h6>Appearence</h6>
							<p>Level 0 is a infinte, square based maze which consists of damp yellow carpet, yellow walls with repeating paterns on them and inconsistently spaced flourecent lights that constantly emmit a low humming noise.</p>
							<h6>Phenomenons</h6>
							<p>Some places in the level do not follow standard physics, you could walk 3 kilometers and have only moved 10 meters in physical distance. This combined with repeating carpet and paterned walls makes navigation extremely difficult. Human contact once inside the level is nearly non-existant, other humans never see eachother, radio frequencies become unreliable and distorted, GPS and satelite signals cant connect to anything. Due to the extreme sensory deprevation People go insane trying to escape and a great number of people have died from starvation, dehydration or psychological trauma. Hullucinations are very common in those that stay for more than 2 weeks (in frontroom time), some hullucinations include: 
								<li>Stairs or Doors</li>
								<li>Distorted human voices</li>
								<li>Déjà vu</li>
								<li>Figures running across hallways seen in peripheral vision</li>
								These can amplify or Increase with extended stay in Level 0, around the 3-6 month mark (depending on the mental foritiude of the indevidual) the person starts to forget things like their name, birthday or parents name. longer than 6 months people start to forget what they, the Frontrooms and other people look like. If they have managed to survive this long they just become souless husk wandering endlessly in search of food.	
							</p>
							<h6>Enties</h6>
							<p>
								<li>Black monsters cmmonly refered to as "Bacteria" can appear at some parts of Level 0 they are unpredictable and can sometimes be very aggressive so contact is not recomended</li>
								<li>Smilers are very rare but sometimes do appear in darker corners of the level that the lights dont reach</li>
							</p>
							<h6>Enterences</h6>
							<p>The Frontrooms is the most consistant way to enter Level 0</p>
							<h6>Exits</h6>
							<p>Level 0 can only be exited by learning how to no-clip</p>
							<h6>Gallery</h6>
